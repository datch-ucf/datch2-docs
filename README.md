The Documenting and Triaging Cultural Heritage (DATCH) project is open-source software for field assessment and documentation of built and movable cultural heritage using mixed reality hardware. The [**Documenting and Triaging Cultural Heritage (DATCH): Damage Assessment and Digital Preservation**](https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&gn=HAA-277278-21) has been made possible in part by a major grant from the [**National Endowment for the Humanities**](https://www.neh.gov/): Democracy demands wisdom.




DATCH permits real-time overlay comparisons of cultural heritage against earlier documentation while also enabling the creation of new scaled drawings using gestures, even in field situations with no network connections. When network connections are available additional features such as video calls with specialists and data sharing with management systems will be enabled. DATCH will aid rapid needs assessments of cultural heritage in conflict situations, ongoing assessments of cultural heritage in the field, and enable fieldwork across multiple disciplines. The prototype software will be developed and field tested with Microsoftâ€™s HoloLens, but with a goal of cross-platform compatibility across head mounted display mixed reality devices.

This repository is the offical DATCH2 **documentation** which has currently been developed in the [**Unity Real-Time Development Platform**](https://unity.com/) for the [**Microsoft HoloLens 2**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/hololens).
