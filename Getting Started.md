- The menu is structured in three panels:
	- **File**
		- Includes basic application-functionalities, such as importing, undoing, and changing accessibility features
	- **Tools**
		- Includes all tools necessary for drawing, manipulating shapes, and other functionalities
	- **Attributes**
		- Changes depending on which tool is selected
		- Displays detailed functionalities and additional buttons for operating when in a certain mode
- Scroll through the different panels by pressing the small arrow buttons surrounding the left and right sides of the DATCH logo button at the bottom of the menu.

> **Note**
> *Features that are currently in progress have been disabled, as indicated by the gray, slashed button and icon.*

### Start Drawing
1. If in the default hand-orientation mode, raise right hand in front of view and pinch and drag in the air to start drawing. While drawing, a bright orange pen will appear in hand.
	- *Note: If the start point of a line is brought near the end point, the ends will connect, closing the shape.*
2. Each drawing created becomes a shape, with a box and handles surrounding it, which can be grabbed and dragged to move, rotate, and scale the shape
3. Select other drawing modes from the **TOOLS** panel in the menu as needed

> The **color** and **weight** of lines can be changed by navigating to the Attributes panel when any drawing mode (freedraw, line, curve) is selected

### Selecting Shapes
- A shape can be selected by hovering the dominant hand a short distance away from it
- When processing a selection, a blue, circular bar will begin filling
- Once filled, the dominant hand will also turn blue and the shape will indicate it is selected with a blue box outline

## Manipulating Shapes
